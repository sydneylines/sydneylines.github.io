Calgary, AB, July 29, 2023.</p>
							<p><b>Organizer</b>, “ASU-K-12 School Gardens.” Organized, planned, and facilitated a one-day workshop with local K-12 teachers and administrators, ASU Ed professors, local non-profits, and ASU Ed students to build new networks and projects on community garden projects at local schools.

							<h3>Performances & Experiences</h3>
							<p><b>Co-Organizer</b>, “RESISTories: Stories from Resistors" (event series) in partnership with Alyssa Sy de Jesus (Museum of Vancouver). ResiStories convened under/misrepresented historically, persistently, systemically marginalized (HPSM) communities to tell their own stories on their own terms in Vancouver’s oldest museum and further engaged HPSM UBC students and faculty working in and with HPSM peoples and cultures in public-facing work and service. The project compensated local HPSM community knowledge holders, artists, and activists engaged in reparative work and supported ongoing collaborative work between academic institutions and community organizations. This event series was competitively funded by the UBC Strategic Equity & Anti-Racism Enhancement Fund.</p><ul>
								<li><b>Jan 11, 2024</b> | <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/making-space">Reimagining Refugee Memoirs</a>: a compelling reading of excerpts from the memoirs, <i>Landbridge</i> by Y-Dang Troeung and Carmen Aguirre‘s <i>Something Fierce: Memoirs of a Revolutionary Daughter</i>. Both Y-Dang and Carmen’s works resist traditional forms of the refugee memoir and examine the problematic image of the “grateful” refugee’s arrival in Canada. The readings were followed by a conversation between Carmen Aguirre, Chris Patterson (Kawika Guillermo), and Dr. Amanda Cheong. This programming engaged with Pier21’s travelling exhibition <i>Refuge Canada</i>—on view at the MOV until February 2nd, 2024.</li>
								<li><b>June 29, 2024</b> | <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/resistories-building-futures">Building Community Futures</a>: Vancouver is full of built environments that are the result of urban planning, grassroots community place-making, and sometimes a bit of both. Depending on their histories, consultation processes, and the intention behind the project, these built environments can be spaces of inclusion for some and exclusion for others. Inspired by The MOV exhibition with artist Yao Jui-Chung, <i>Mirage: Disused Public Property in Taiwan</i>, we ask: who are built environments in Vancouver for and why? What can be done to address the inequities of public space-making? At this lunch-and-learn, two graduates of the UBC School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (SALA) presented their research and proposals on the local urban planning process and its effects on community spaces and futures. </li>
								<li><b>Aug 22, 2024</b> | <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/resistories-pride">Living Archives of Pride</a>: This event aimed to honour our local 2SLGBTQIA+ icons and histories and the “living archive” today’s community embodies and represents. Emceed by Shay Dior, attendees witnessed drag performances by Continental Breakfast, Count Cupid, and Mx Bukuru, who all took inspiration from queer historical moments and icons to create their sets. Scholars of queer culture and archives—and drag—gathered with the drag artists in a panel discussion about the queer references, histories, and memory embodied in their performances.</li></ul></p>
							<p><b>Co-Organizer</b>, “Making Space" (event series) in partnership with Alyssa Sy de Jesus (Museum of Vancouver) and Bill Yuen (Heritage Vancouver Society). The event series aimed to make space for community dialogue around topics of culture and heritage in conversation with the exhibit “A Seat at the Table,” which celebrated Chinese Canadian Heritage identities and experiences through the lens of food and restaurant culture.</p><ul>
								<li><b>Nov 19, 2022</b> | <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/making-space">Banning BBQ Meats</a>: a lunch and learn screening of the short documentary film “Under Fire: Inside a Chinese Roasted Meat Shop in Vancouver.” After the screening, participants broke into smaller discussion groups to “make space” for food cultures as an important part of one’s heritage.</li>
								<li><b>May 18, 2023</b> | <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/making-space-asian-heritage-month">Asian Heritage Month</a>: in this panel of four local activists who are working for their communities in mindful and intersectional ways through cultural food justice, we asked what we have learned from the exhibition, and how we can continue to work with Asian Canadian Communities in the future. In the context of curatorial practices and beyond, how can cultural institutions intentionally make space for the responsibilities and reciprocities of representation?</li></ul></p>
